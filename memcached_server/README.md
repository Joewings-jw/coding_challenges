## Build Your Own Memcached Server

This challenge entails building your own Memcached server, a high-performance, distributed memory object caching system. Memcached is designed to speed up dynamic web applications by alleviating database load.

### Key Features of Memcached:

- **In-Memory Key-Value Store:** Memcached stores small chunks of arbitrary data in memory, retrieved from backend systems with higher latency.
  
- **Simplicity and Power:** Despite its simplicity, Memcached is a powerful tool that promotes quick deployment, ease of development, and solves many problems faced by large data caches.

- **Simple API:** Memcached provides a relatively simple API that is available for most popular programming languages, making it accessible for developers across various platforms.

### Background:

- **Origin:** Memcached was originally developed by Brad Fitzpatrick for LiveJournal in 2003.
  
- **Programming Languages:** Initially written in Perl, Memcached was later ported to C, enhancing its performance and reliability.

This challenge offers an opportunity to delve into the architecture and functionality of Memcached, providing hands-on experience in building a distributed memory caching system.
