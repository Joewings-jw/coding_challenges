# Coding Challenges Repository

Welcome to the Coding Challenges Repository!

This repository contains a curated collection of coding challenges that have personally helped me as a software engineer to level up my skills through deliberate practice.

## Purpose

- These challenges serve as valuable exercises for learning new programming languages or technologies.
- They are designed to simulate real-world scenarios and are often based on practical tools and utilities.
- Each challenge in this repository requires the development of a full application or tool.

## Source of Inspiration

This work is heavily inspired by [coding challenges](https://codingchallenges.fyi/). I've drawn inspiration from their approach and have adapted it to create this repository.

Feel free to explore the challenges, and I hope they help you in your journey of skill enhancement and mastery.

Happy coding!
